#### **Accommodation for Neurodiversity and Disability** 

In our class, we are committed to creating a learning environment where all students can thrive, including those with disabilities or who are neurodivergent. 

However, to receive proper accommodation, you must register with ASU's [Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services](https://eoss.asu.edu/accessibility) and request the accommodations. All information shared with SAILS or me is confidential. 

Email: Student.Accessibility@asu.edu

SAILS Phone: 480-965-1234

The SAILS Tempe office is located on the first floor of the Matthews Center Building.

#### **Accommodation for Religious Practices** 

The university community should, in all its activities, be sensitive to the religious practices of the various religious faiths represented in its student body and employees. Faculty are asked to recognize the obligations of their students who may be participating in the observance of religious holidays. Students should notify faculty at the beginning of the semester about the need to be absent from class due to religious observances. For more information, visit http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-04.html



#### **Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities**

Students who participate in university-sanctioned activities that require classes to be missed shall be given opportunities to make up examinations and other graded in-class work. Normally, the made-up work will be due on the class day immediately after the absence. Absence from class or examinations due to university-sanctioned activities does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the coursework required during the period of the absence. For more information, visit http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html



#### **Academic Integrity and Anti-Plagiarism Policy** 

Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, and laboratory work, academic transactions, and records.  The possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties, course failure (indicated on the transcript as a grade of E), course failure due to academic dishonesty (indicated on the transcript as a grade of XE), loss of registration privileges, disqualification, and dismissal.  For more information, see http://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity 

Plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Students must take the exams independently without assistance from other students. Students may not submit papers written by persons other than themselves. Students must submit original work for this course and may not submit papers previously submitted to (an) other class (es). The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail. These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not limited to: (1) Cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment; (2) Plagiarizing; (3) Academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information; (4) Aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately collaborating; (5) Falsifying academic records. See https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity



#### **Special Notation about AI** 

In this class, you are welcome to use AI tools like ChatGPT to help you brainstorm, explore ideas, generate outlines, or rephrase **your own writing**. You should never ask AI, "Help me write a speech for my persuasive speech class." And it is considered academic integrity. 

AI has hallucinations, which means that LLMs (Large Language Models) could generate and present non-existent, fabricated, or incorrect content as fact. You are responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of all work you present or submit. 

You should also cite AI assistance, depending on how you use it, like "ChatGPT rephrases this outline."





#### **Disruptive, Threatening, or Violent Behavior**

In the classroom and out, students are required to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes an environment that is safe and conducive to learning and conducting other university-related business. All incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student will be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students. Such incidents will be dealt with in accordance with the policies and procedures described in Section 104-02 of the Student Services Manual, available at http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-02.html



#### **Copyright**

Students must refrain from uploading to any course shell, discussion board, or website used by the course instructor or other course forum, material that is not the student's original work, unless the students first comply with all applicable copyright laws; faculty members reserve the right to delete materials on the grounds of suspected copyright infringement. For more information, see the Computer, Internet, & Electronic Communications Policy at http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html



#### **Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation**

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex are prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs. 

As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling, is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.
